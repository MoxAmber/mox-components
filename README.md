# mox-components
Simple, accessible Web Components

## Installation
This isn't packaged anywhere right now, and may never be, who knows.

`npm i github:moxamber/mox-components`

## Motivation
As a React developer I often find myself rewriting a handful of base components and utilities over and over.
This repo is intended to provide myself a useful reference for a (mostly) unstyled, but functional and accessible,
base version of these components I can build on and share with others.  
It's also a fun way to learn more about Web Components üòÅ

## Compatibility
This project is written to support ES2021.

## Components
All components are documented in Storybook. It is currently not hosted anywhere, but can be run locally using  
`npm run storybook`

### mox-modal
A basic modal built on `<dialog>`, with click-outside behaviour and a default header with a close button.

Usage:
```html
  <mox-modal>
    <h1 slot="title">Title</h1>
    <p>Content</p>
  </mox-modal>
```

### mox-visually-hidden
Hide content visually, while still rendering it in the accessibility tree. A common use-case for this
would be providing additional useful context to screen-readers, or for hidden 'skip to content' links.

Usage:
```html
<mox-visually-hidden>
  <a href='#content'>Skip to content</a>
</mox-visually-hidden>
```

## Planned Components
**MediaObject** - 2 column box with an image and some amount of content (eg. a Facebook status)  
**Accordion** - Stack of collapsible panels that contain large amounts of content (eg. FAQs)  
**Dropdown** - A dropdown menu  
**Tabs** - A set of containers controlled by tabs
